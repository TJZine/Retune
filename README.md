## What is Retune?

Retune transforms your Plex media library into simulated **live television channels** on your LG Smart TV. Instead of browsing and selecting content on-demand, you can tune into curated channels that play content on a schedule—just like traditional broadcast TV.

**Perfect for**:

- 🛋️ Passive viewing without decision fatigue
- 📺 Recreating the "cable TV" experience with your own content
- 🎬 Themed movie marathons that run themselves
- 📼 Nostalgic channel surfing through your media library
