# Your First Custom Channel

The magic of Retune is creating channels that feel like broadcast TV but play **your** content. Let's create a "Cinema 24/7" channel.

## 1. Open the Channel Editor

1. Press **Back** to bring up the menu overlay.
2. Select **"Channels"** (or the gear icon).
3. Select **"New Channel"**.

## 2. Basic Configuration

- **Number**: `10` (or any available number)
- **Name**: `Cinema 24/7`
- **Icon**: Select the `Movie Projector` icon.

## 3. Select Content

1. Choose **"Content Source"**.
2. Select **"Library"**.
3. Choose your **Movies** library.
4. (Optional) **Filter**:
   - Select **"Genre"** -> **"Action"**
   - Click **Add Filter**
   - Result: Only Action movies will play on this channel.

## 4. Set Playback Mode

Choose how the content plays:

- **Shuffle** (Recommended): Plays movies in random order. The order is determined daily, so everyone sees the same "random" schedule.
- **Sequential**: Plays movies alphabetically (A-Z).
- **Random**: True random shuffle (change every time).

## 5. Save and Tune

1. Select **"Save Channel"**.
2. Press **Back** to return to play.
3. Type `10` and `OK` (or use CH keys) to tune to your new channel.

## Pro Tip: Collections

You can also create channels from **Plex Collections**.

1. In Plex, create a Collection named "Star Wars Universe".
2. In Retune, New Channel -> Content Source -> **Collection**.
3. Select "Star Wars Universe".
4. Set Playback Mode to **Sequential**.

Now you have a channel that plays Star Wars content in chronological order, appearing like a marathon!
