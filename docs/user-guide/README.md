## Common Tasks

### How do I refresh content?

If you've added new movies to Plex, Retune will pick them up automatically the next time the channel playlist regenerates (usually daily). You can force a refresh by editing the channel and saving it again.

### Can I use multiple Plex servers?

Yes! You can mix content from different servers on different channels. Retune will automatically connect to the correct server when you tune in.

### Does it support 4K / HDR?

Yes, Retune instructs the efficient webOS player to use Direct Play whenever possible. If your TV supports the format and network bandwidth is sufficient, 4K HDR works great.
