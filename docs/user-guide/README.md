## Common Tasks

### How do I refresh content?

If you've added new movies to Plex, Retune will pick them up automatically the next time the channel schedule regenerates (typically when a new day begins or when you edit/save the channel). You can force a refresh by editing the channel and saving it again.

### Can I use multiple Plex servers?

Yes! You can mix content from different servers on different channels. Retune will automatically connect to the correct server when you tune in.

### Does it support 4K / HDR?

Yes, Retune instructs the native webOS player to use Direct Play (streaming without server-side transcoding) whenever possible. If your TV supports the format and network bandwidth is sufficient, 4K HDR works great.
