# Electronic Program Guide (EPG)

The EPG is your main interface for seeing what's on and what's coming up.

## Opening the Guide

- **Remote**: Press the **Guide** button (if available) or navigate to the "Guide" button in the on-screen menu.
- **Keyboard**: Press **'G'**.

## Navigation

The EPG uses a familiar grid layout:

- **Rows**: Represent channels.
- **Columns**: Represent time slots (30-minute intervals).
- **Current Time**: Marked by a vertical line.
